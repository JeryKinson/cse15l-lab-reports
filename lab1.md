**1. Installing Vscode**
Go to google and try to search VScode. Then download the VScode from the offical website. Also install it on you local desktop.

**2. Remotely Connecting**
First you need to get your remote access account. On windows we also need to install OpenSSH. Then open the terminal on your laptop or search it. Since we need to use SSH to get remote access so try to type in the command *ssh xxx(your account name)@ieng6.ucsd.edu*.
<br /><br />

**3. Trying Some Commands**
After we are on the remote access to our account, try some common commands which are very useful. Like *cd* or *cd..*, this command will lead you move to a child directory or back to a parent directory. And also *ls* or *ls -a* will show the list of the file or the list including the hidden file. Other commands you may try like *cat*, *touch*, *rm*, *cp* and so on.
